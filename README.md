# cutepiesmtp
Cute SMPT Daemon is a fake SMTP server created for debugging and development purposes. The app listens on localhost, intercepts email messages, and writes them to a standard Unix mailbox file. The app can also open an existing Unix mailbox file or raw email messages in EML/MSG format. To strip styles and scripts from the HTML messages use Config > 'Enable HTML cleaning' Cute Pie SMTP Daemon is capable of extracting and saving attachments from mailboxes or from EML/MSG files. Running the SMTP server on port 25 requires root priveleges. To run as a regular user, set a port higher than 1024, and configure your email clients to use that port.
